## How to do exercises and submit
- Fork this repo and clone this repo.
- Make a new git branch `feature/exercise_x`, where `x` is the exercises number.
- Do your exercise using that branch.
- Create a pull request (PR) to `main` branch and assign to `@dangcuong-123` for reviewing.
- `@dangcuong-123` will review, give feedback.
- 1 excercise is designed for 1 week of work but candidates are recommended to submit earlier.
- Note that excercises are for your practice, so books, Internet, mentors are your friends. Don't hesitate to ask your mentors.

Good luck and have fun! ðŸ˜‰
